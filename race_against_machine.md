## Project Overview

The "Race Against the Machine" project was a comprehensive research initiative conducted during the winter semester of 2021/2022 at TU Dortmund University. The project explored the intersection of 5G communication technology and autonomous vehicle systems, focusing on teleoperated driving scenarios using the F1/10 platform. The project investigated the robustness of private 5G networks in teleoperated driving and implemented various approaches for autonomous driving in a controlled laboratory environment.

## Technical Approach

### 5G-Enabled Teleoperation
The project leveraged 5G communication technology to achieve high-quality teleoperation with low latency and high resilience. The Quality of Experience (QoE) for teleoperated driving scenarios was evaluated by analyzing both application-specific requirements and the Quality of Service (QoS) provided by the network infrastructure.

### Autonomous Driving Implementation
Multiple autonomous driving approaches were developed and tested:
- **Direct Teleoperation:** Real-time remote control using 5G networks
- **Indirect Teleoperation:** Semi-autonomous systems with human oversight
- **Vision-Based Autonomous Driving:** Fully autonomous navigation using computer vision

### Digital Twin Integration
A sophisticated web-based digital twin was developed with ROS integration to visualize:
- Real-time vehicle locations and states
- Environmental conditions and obstacles
- Network performance metrics
- Track boundaries and navigation paths
