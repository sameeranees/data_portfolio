## [Master Thesis: Autonomous Navigation of Multi-Robot Systems in Dynamic Warehousing and Rescue Environments](master_thesis.md)

[Read detailed thesis information](master_thesis.md)

**Duration:** 2023-2024  
**Technologies:** ROS 2, ISAAC Sim, Gazebo, Python, PyTorch, CUDA  
**Status:** Completed (October 2024)

A comprehensive research project comparing Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms (DQN, DDPG, TD3) for autonomous robot navigation across multiple simulation platforms. Achieved 78.4% success rate with DDPG in Gazebo environments and successfully extended single-robot algorithms to multi-robot scenarios. The project includes complete integration with traditional navigation stacks and provides valuable insights for intralogistics and disaster management applications.

**Key Contributions:**
- Systematic comparison of DRL algorithms across ISAAC Sim and Gazebo platforms
- Multi-robot navigation system implementation
- Integration of DRL local planner with global navigation stack
- Comprehensive hyperparameter optimization and performance analysis
