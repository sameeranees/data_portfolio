## Project Overview

This project implements an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques to analyze credit card applications and determine approval or rejection decisions. The system automates the manual review process traditionally performed by banks, demonstrating practical application of machine learning in financial services and risk assessment.

The project addresses the critical need for efficient credit assessment in the banking industry, where manual review processes are time-consuming, error-prone, and costly. By implementing automated decision-making systems, financial institutions can improve processing speed while maintaining accuracy and consistency in credit decisions.
