## Dataset and Methodology

### Dataset Characteristics
The analysis utilizes a comprehensive dataset containing 131 student records with 22 categorical features representing various aspects of student life and academic environment:

**Demographic Information:**
- Gender, caste, marital status, living situation
- Family size and accommodation type

**Academic Performance:**
- Test scores across multiple subjects (TNP, TWP, IAP, ESP)
- Attendance patterns and academic performance levels

**Family Background:**
- Parental education levels and occupations
- Family income and financial status

## Machine Learning Implementation

### Algorithm Comparison
The project implements and evaluates five different classification algorithms to determine the most effective approach for student performance prediction:

#### 1. Logistic Regression
Logistic regression serves as the baseline algorithm for binary classification tasks. The model provides interpretable results and establishes a performance benchmark for comparison with more complex algorithms.

#### 2. Random Forest Classifier
The Random Forest algorithm employs ensemble learning with multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy. The implementation includes hyperparameter optimization through random state testing to identify optimal model configurations.

#### 3. Naive Bayes Classifier
The Naive Bayes approach assumes feature independence and provides probabilistic classification. This algorithm demonstrates particular effectiveness with categorical data and offers computational efficiency advantages.

#### 4. Neural Network (MLP)
A Multi-Layer Perceptron neural network provides non-linear modeling capabilities for complex pattern recognition. The implementation utilizes scikit-learn's MLPClassifier with default parameters for baseline performance assessment.

#### 5. Decision Tree Classifier
Decision trees offer interpretable classification with clear decision boundaries. The implementation includes random state optimization to identify the most effective tree configuration for the dataset.

### Model Evaluation Framework
The evaluation methodology employs a systematic approach to ensure reliable performance assessment:

**Train-Test Split:** An 80-20 split provides sufficient training data while maintaining adequate test samples for validation.

**Cross-Validation:** Multiple random states are tested for algorithms that include randomization, ensuring robust performance evaluation.

**Performance Metrics:** Accuracy scores provide direct comparison across different algorithms, enabling identification of the most effective approach.
