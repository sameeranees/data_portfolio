## Project Overview

This project represents a comprehensive tower defense game developed in C++ using the SDL2 graphics library, demonstrating mastery of advanced object-oriented programming principles. The game showcases complex inheritance hierarchies, polymorphism, encapsulation, and design patterns through an engaging real-time strategy experience.

The project serves as a practical demonstration of how object-oriented programming concepts can be applied to create sophisticated software systems, combining theoretical knowledge with hands-on implementation in game development.

## Technical Architecture

### Object-Oriented Design Principles

#### Inheritance Hierarchy
The game implements a sophisticated class hierarchy with GameObject serving as the base class for all game entities:

- **GameObject:** Abstract base class providing common functionality
- **Tower Classes:** Specialized defensive units with unique capabilities
- **Enemy Classes:** Various enemy types with different behaviors
- **Projectile System:** Dynamic projectile management with collision detection

#### Polymorphism Implementation
Virtual functions enable runtime behavior selection, allowing different object types to respond appropriately to common interface calls while maintaining their unique characteristics.

#### Encapsulation Strategy
Private data members are protected through public interfaces, ensuring data integrity while providing controlled access to object functionality.

### Core Game Systems

#### Tower Defense Mechanics
The game implements classic tower defense gameplay with strategic depth:

- **Tower Placement:** Strategic positioning of defensive structures
- **Enemy Waves:** Progressive difficulty with varied enemy compositions
- **Resource Management:** Economic system balancing tower costs and upgrades
- **Pathfinding:** Intelligent enemy movement along predefined routes

#### Real-time Graphics System
SDL2-based rendering provides smooth 60 FPS gameplay with:

- **Sprite Animation:** Frame-based animation system for all game entities
- **Particle Effects:** Visual feedback for explosions and special abilities
- **UI Rendering:** Dynamic health bars, money display, and game state indicators
- **Camera System:** Smooth scrolling and zoom functionality

## Game Features

### Tower Types and Abilities

#### Basic Tower
- **Ability:** Single-target engagement with consistent damage

#### Rocket Turret
- **Ability:** Splash damage affecting multiple enemies

#### Cannon
- **Ability:** Piercing shots that can damage multiple enemies in line

#### Electric Cannon
- **Ability:** Electricity jumps between nearby enemies

#### Enemy Types and Behaviors:
- Soldiers
- Tanks
- Aircraft

## Technical Implementation

### Development Environment
The project utilizes industry-standard tools and libraries:

- **C++ Programming Language:** Core implementation with modern C++ features
- **SDL2 Graphics Library:** Cross-platform graphics and input handling
- **SDL2_image:** Image loading and texture management
- **SDL2_mixer:** Audio playback and sound effect management
- **Code::Blocks IDE:** Integrated development environment

### Memory Management
Efficient resource management ensures stable performance:

- **Dynamic Allocation:** Smart pointer usage for automatic memory management
- **Texture Caching:** Optimized image loading and storage

### Performance Optimization
The game maintains consistent performance through:

- **Object Pooling:** Reuse of frequently created objects
- **Memory Optimization:** Minimal memory footprint with maximum functionality

## Game Systems

### Save/Load Functionality
Persistent game state management enables:

- **Progress Saving:** Complete game state preservation
- **Settings Persistence:** User preferences and configuration storage

### Audio System
Comprehensive sound design enhances gameplay experience:

- **Background Music:** Dynamic soundtrack adapting to game state
- **Sound Effects:** Distinctive audio feedback for all game actions

### User Interface
Intuitive interface design provides clear game information:

- **Health Display:** Real-time player health monitoring
- **Resource Counter:** Current money and upgrade availability
- **Tower Selection:** Clear visual feedback for tower placement
- **Game State Indicators:** Pause, game over, and victory screens

## Learning Outcomes
